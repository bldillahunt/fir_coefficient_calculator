# fir_filter_coefficients
This Python script will create the coefficients of an FIR filter based on parameters entered by the user. These parameters include the number of coefficients (even or odd), the type of filter (low pass or high pass), and the cutoff frequency. The ideal frequency response gets created using an FFT size of 2048576 and a sample rate of 250 MHz. This signal then goes through an IFFT to obtain the filter's impulse response. A window the size of the coefficient count entered by the user and located in the center of the spectrum is used to obtain the coefficients. The first plot that gets generated shows the output of the IFFT (imaginary and real components) The user is given the option to test the filter with either a fixed frequency or with a frequency sweep (currently, it only sweeps upward). The next plot shows the time domain of this signal before filtering and then the following plot shows this signal after filtering. The outputs of FFTs of the unfiltered signal and of the filtered signal are then plotted. The final plot shows the frequency response of the filter in normalized frequency and the phase response in normalized frequency.
